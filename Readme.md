## Day 1

1. TypeScript is an object oriented programming language that is built on top of JavaScript with extra features.
2. JavaScript is extended to TypeScript
3. As JavaScript is dynamically typed, the type checking becomes a hassle when working on a big-scale project that requires validation quite often as a result TypeScript is a wise choice to use.
4. The errors involved with type checking will not be shown if the project is coded in JavaScript as JavaScript informs about errors in runtime rather than in compiled time.
5. JavaScript does not support OOP. JavaScript uses OOP with the help of syntactic sugar.
6. Typescript is transpiled to JavaScript and the interesting fact is a developer can choose which version of JS (ES3, ES5, ES6) the TypeScript should be converted to.
7. Browser cannot run TypeScript
8. TypeScript can use JavaScript types like number, string, boolean,null, undefined, object and symbol
9. TypeScript has its own types like Interface, Void, Array, Tuple, Enum , Union and Intersection
10. Increase productivity by giving suggestions what you have used like the types and number of parameters when using a code of a different file
11. Takes less time in testing as bugs are easy to find and also few bugs will be available
12. Type complexities like a small code will also needs it types to be mentioned
13. Limited Library Support, Over Engineering and Migration Challenges
